<h1>BFS and A* algorithm</h1>
Implementation of two algorithms based on searching for a goal in a maze where at the end of the algorithm the desired route is displayed.
<h2>Best First Search algorithm</h2>
Best First Search algorithm in which evaluation is done according to distance from the target point (F=H).
<h2>A* algorithm</h2>
Algorithm A* in which the evaluation is done according to the sum of the distance from the starting point and the estimated distance to the destination point (F=G+H).
